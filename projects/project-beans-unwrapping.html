                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    To design and manufacture a beans unwrapping machine using limited materials to address the issue of
                    low beans production efficiency and quality by automating the unwrapping process for small and
                    medium enterprises in Cameroon and Central Africa. The idea for this project came to me in an
                    attempt to explore another culture while trying to affect social change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Invited by a friend of mine, I visited Maroua, a city in the northern region of Cameroon for
                    tourism. I met some local bean farmers and processors and observed their traditional methods of
                    unwrapping beans. Astonished by how slow and labour-intensive these methods were, I decided to
                    investigate the problem further. The overarching goal was to develop my understanding of the machine
                    design process and to further my competency in mechanical engineering design and machining. This
                    project was done in 2 months.

                <h3>Technical Development</h3>
                <p>
                    After one week of design, fabrication and adventures to larger cities to track down required
                    mechanical and electrical components with the limited resources in my possession, we had a complete
                    motor with all its affiliated components, a fan, and some steel materials which will serve in the
                    manufacturing of the frame, the shaft, the hopper...etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I had some friends to help out too, this was my first big engineering project I took from
                    concept to conclusion largely unassisted. During the project, I welded the frame and the shaft's
                    blades, developed sketches and sketch models, gathered materials, and fabricated the hole assembly.

             ================================================ -->

            <!-- Text Content -->
            <div class="project-section-content">
                <h3>Design & Build</h3>
                <p>
                    Initially, I brainstormed and prototyped competing designs. The final design was selected based on
                    the raw materials available, the parallel motor configuration, and the fan position. These features
                    offered more stability and reduced the vibration rate of the machine, which was essential for the
                    desired outcome.
                </p>

                <h4>Shaft Design</h4>
                <p>
                    To optimize the shaft for the desired torque and speed specifications, I developed blades of
                    variable dimensions with a 5cm distance between each other, mounted at 120 degrees circularly. This
                    ensured proper unwrapping of the beans and proper rotation of the shaft with respect to the motor
                    force to prevent the beans from breaking.

                <h4>Power Transmission</h4>
                <p>
                    A double groove pulley was used to connect directly the motor, shaft and fan, partitioning the
                    driving force of the motor between the shaft and the fan. The motor required was a closed
                    asynchronous motor LS90L of Pm = 1.1 kw and speed of rotation Nm = 1500rpm. However, this motor was
                    not available, so a Ys series tree-phase asynchronous JB/T 1009-2007 motor was used instead.
                </p>

                <h4>Compact Design</h4>
                <p>
                    A flexible CAD assembly of the different components was used to keep the machine as short as
                    possible. Knowing from previous works how the bulkiness of a machine matters, I opted for a narrow
                    model. This allows easy access to the shaft for refinement and repair. The pulley and belt are
                    placed on the outside to permit easy interchangeability.

                <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>
                    To ensure ease of manufacturing, we focused mainly on the design of the frame and the shaft. During
                    the design process, I took great care in selecting the appropriate steel thickness, as it plays a
                    significant role in determining the overall weight of the machine. The shaft on the other hand
                    required a lot of precision i.e. If the shaft rotated too fast and the spacing between the mobile
                    blades and the large movable blades wasn't appropriate, it instantaneously led to bean braking or
                    missing to hit the target (beans).
                </p>

                <h4>Solution Retained</h4>
                <p>
                    The final design was chosen not only based on its ease of manufacturing but also due to the ability
                    of fabricating it with the raw materials we possessed.

                    The dried bean pods are introduced into the hopper <strong>(1)</strong>. When the motor
                    <strong>(16)</strong> is activated, this transmits its movement to the main shaft
                    <strong>(6)</strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The beating of the pods between the moving blades <strong>(5)</strong> and the fixed blades
                    <strong>(3)</strong> causes the unwrapping action. The sorting between the seeds and the pods is
                    carried out by the fan with blades <strong>(4)</strong> thanks to the system
                    <strong>(13+14+15)</strong>. The grains are directed to exit <strong>(8)</strong> and the pods are

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I couldn't have completed the Bur machine without the help of Nepitimbaye and Grace (2D drafters)
                    and the wisdom of my friend Tatsinda, an ex-control engineering student. They provided invaluable
                    technical advice and perspectives on how to consider the unexpected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the Bur machine was a relatively simple project, Allan taught me how to walk through the
                    system and consider exactly what each component does. This seemingly simple lesson was truly
                    valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned an important lesson in management style. I started as the sole designer and
                    implementer, but slowly transitioned to more management. There is overhead associated with each new
                    team member, both in terms of onboarding and communication. For example, if a task is small enough,
                    I may want to do it myself instead of spending the effort to communicate what needs to be done.
                    However, this approach should be used sparingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are willing to expend the effort to teach and communicate base skills and expectations, the
                    cost to execute tasks goes down. After a while, our smart team was able to extrapolate and operate
                    more autonomously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adage "If you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself" doesn't hold true here.
                    The addendum should be: "If you want something done right, you've got to communicate well and put in
                    the work to set teammates up for success". I know this is an obvious principle, but living it was a
                    visceral experience.
