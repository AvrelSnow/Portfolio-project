                <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
                <p>
                    In Cameroon, wheelbarrows are important for construction, farming, and market activities, but
                    traditional ones require heavy manual effort. Our goal was simple but ambitious: design a motorized
                    wheelbarrow that is easy to use, comfortable, and adaptable to users of different heights, while
                    working with limited resources and without relying on 3D modeling or simulations. Everything had to
                    come from our hands, minds, and experience.
                    <br><br>The first challenge was finding the right motor. We quickly realized that automotive motors,
                    like those from Nissan or Toyota bikes, were too bulky, non-automatic, and hard to integrate with a
                    human-friendly wheelbarrow height. So, we chose a reconditioned e-scooter motor, which came
                    pre-mounted with a wheel <strong>(~35–40 cm)</strong>. This was perfect for ergonomics, easier
                    handling, and
                    integration with our wheelbarrow design.
                    <br><br>It took <strong>three weeks</strong> to source a reliable motor within our tight budget.
                    Tchoffo and I
                    handled
                    the electrical refurbishment, fixing the motor so it could reliably start and run under load.

                <h3>CONTENT</h3>
                <p>
                    Building the wheelbarrow was purely hands-on engineering: welding, cutting, and assembling the
                    frame. <strong>No CAD, no simulations—just experience, measurement, and iterative thinking.</strong>
                    We focused on
                    the battery and oil tank placement ensuring it is secured yet accessible for maintenance. We
                    emphasized on the wheel and handle configuration making it comfortable and suitable for users from
                    1.5 m to 1.9 m, whether male or female. A motor integration with handles in such a way that starting
                    the motor felt like riding a motorized bike, intuitive for the user. In this journey, collaboration
                    was key. For instance, Badou suggested adding an adjustable “elevator” system so shorter users could
                    stand comfortably. On the contrary, Tchoffo opposed it due to budget limits.it posed a serious
                    issues cause as the team lead, I had to figure out an equitable outcome to this problem. My proposal
                    was to use larger wheels, which raised the user slightly, balancing comfort and cost.
                    <br><br>User-centered design was crucial. We continuously tested the wheelbarrow with each team
                    member to ensure ergonomic comfort and safe handling, adjusting measurements to accommodate
                    everyone.

                <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>
                    The motorized wheelbarrow was successfully completed in three weeks. It comfortably supports:
                <ul>
                    <li>Male users: 1.75–1.90 m</li>
                    <li>Female users: 1.50–1.90 m </li>
                </ul><br>
                Hands-on measurement and practical iteration allowed us to finish the project faster than creating 3D
                models, 2D plans, and simulations, which could have taken 4–6 weeks longer given our team’s resources.
                Some of the key lessons learned here was that.<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not all projects need CAD or simulation:</strong> Real-world iteration works, and
                        sometimes faster;</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration matters:</strong> Understanding each team member’s perspective ensures
                        designs are
                        functional, inclusive, and cost-effective;</li>
                    <li><strong>Ergonomics and comfort are essential:</strong> A mechanical design is only useful if the
                        user can operate
                        it safely and easily:</li>
                    <li><strong>Resourcefulness drives innovation:</strong> Limited budget pushed us to find creative,
                        practical
                        solutions, like the larger wheels instead of an expensive adjustable platform.</li>
                </ul>
                This project refined my mechanical design, electrical troubleshooting, and collaborative engineering
                skills.
