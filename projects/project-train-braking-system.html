                        <h2>Context</h2>
                        <p>For our work on the brake triangle, I was part of a team of four engineers tasked with
                            reproducing new brake triangles compatible with the CC2200 and CC3300AC locomotives. We were
                            required to manufacture two different brake triangles to address the problem of stock
                            shortages, as these locomotives were very old and their spare parts were no longer available
                            on the market. It was therefore necessary to produce their components locally.</p>
                        <p>The objective was to design a system that closely matched and remained fully compatible with
                            these locomotives while ensuring acceptable durability and functional performance comparable
                            to the original imported parts.</p>
                        <p>As part of the project requirements, we transitioned from the older Shielded Metal Arc
                            Welding (SMAW) method—commonly known as arc welding with coated electrodes—to more advanced
                            welding techniques: MIG-MAG (Metal Inert Gas – Metal Active Gas). This shift aimed to
                            improve weld quality, structural integrity, and compliance with the structural standards and
                            regulations of the Cameroonian railway system.</p>
                        <p>To facilitate this change, we were equipped with the Lincoln Electric Power MIG 360MP and 2
                            Fronius TransSteel 2700.</p>
                        <p>My specific objective in this project was to produce detailed 2D diagrams and 3D models,
                            ensuring that all dimensions and tolerances remained within acceptable limits. This was
                            essential to guarantee that the brake triangles could be easily integrated into the
                            locomotives and perform the same function as the reference components.</p>

                    <article class="intro-column">
                        <h2>Content</h2>
                        <p>In this project, our team of four (consisting of Gille team lead, Mbella Jacques chief
                            technician and his assistant Ricardo) produced two brake triangles: one for the CC2200
                            locomotives and one for the CC3300-AC locomotives. Each brake triangle had distinct
                            specifications, including different diameters and dimensions, which required careful
                            planning
                            and collaboration within the team.</p>
                        <p>For the CC3300, we utilized UPN profiles, which we bent and cut into the required shapes. Our
                            team added end caps to achieve the correct mass while maintaining the necessary diameter.
                            Following this, we reproduced the front shoes. I was responsible for creating detailed 2D
                            drawings and 3D models of the front shoes. Using calipers, measuring tapes, and other
                            traditional reverse engineering methods, I ensured that these components were not only
                            accurately reproducible but also fully manufacturable, in alignment with our project
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>For the CC3300-AC, we machined rectangular iron bars and shaped them into circular forms,
                            closely matching the existing brake triangles. By applying traditional reverse engineering
                            techniques—including manual measurement, geometric analysis, precise dimensioning, and
                            tolerance verification—I produced precise and manufacturable 2D drawings. This approach
                            ensured that each assembly fit accurately and that the components could fully reproduce
                            their
                            intended function.</p>
                        <p>During the project, I worked closely with my team. I helped in the organization of tasks. I
                            also shared ideas and suggestions to help the project move forward (the ideas for the end
                            caps were mine). By working together, we completed all the steps—from machining the raw
                            material, welding the different components, to testing them—to ensure they matched the
                            function and characteristics of the original brake triangles.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Through this project, I learned an important lesson about the value of collaboration between
                            designers and manufacturers. In my experience, when working in a design office, it is easy
                            to
                            assume that theoretical work—such as 3D modeling and detailed drawings—is sufficient to
                            produce a component. We sometimes think we can complete a design without consulting the
                            manufacturer.</p>
                        <p>However, this project demonstrated how critical the role of the manufacturer is. They not
                            only
                            help you understand appropriate tolerances based on the materials and machinery available
                            but
                            also enable you to complete the work more efficiently. For example, during the reproduction
                            of the front shoes for the CC3300-AC locomotives, I initially applied tolerances that were
                            not suitable for manufacturing because I assumed that their tools and capabilities were the
                            same as those I had encountered in previous workplaces.</p>
                        <p>This approach cost the team a significant amount of time, as we constantly had to review
                            details and ensure that the dimensions were both acceptable and manufacturable. From this
                            experience, I gained a deeper understanding of practical dimensioning techniques and learned
                            how to work humbly and effectively with the manufacturer. By consulting them during the
                            design process, we were able to reduce errors and save time.</p>
                        <p><strong>"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."</strong> In
                            my case, especially, working alone often led to mistakes, whereas collaborating closely with
                            the team and manufacturers resulted in fewer errors and faster, more accurate outcomes.</p>
