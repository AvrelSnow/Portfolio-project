                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    For our work on the brake triangle, I was part of a team of four engineers tasked with reproducing
                    new brake triangles compatible with the <strong>CC2200</strong> and <strong>CC3300AC</strong>
                    locomotives. We were required to manufacture two different brake triangles to address the problem of
                    stock shortages, as these locomotives were very old and their spare parts were no longer available
                    on the market. It was therefore necessary to produce their components locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective was to design a system that closely matched and remained fully compatible with these
                    locomotives while ensuring acceptable durability and functional performance comparable to the
                    original imported parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the project requirements, we transitioned from the older Shielded Metal Arc Welding
                    (SMAW) method—commonly known as arc welding with coated electrodes—to more advanced welding
                    techniques: <strong>MIG-MAG</strong> (Metal Inert Gas – Metal Active Gas). This shift aimed to
                    improve weld quality, structural integrity, and compliance with the structural standards and
                    regulations of the Cameroonian railway system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To facilitate this change, we were equipped with the <strong>Lincoln Electric Power MIG
                        360MP</strong>
                    and <strong>2 Fronius TransSteel 2700</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My specific objective in this project was to produce detailed 2D diagrams and 3D models, ensuring
                    that all dimensions and tolerances remained within acceptable limits. This was essential to
                    guarantee that the brake triangles could be easily integrated into the locomotives and perform the
                    same function as the reference components. The task was conducted as a reverse engineering project,
                    taking into account existing designs, spatial constraints, functional requirements, and local
                    material availability.

                <h3>Technical Development</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, our team of four (consisting of Gille team lead, Mbella Jacques chief technician
                    and his assistant Ricardo) produced two brake triangles: one for the <strong>CC2200</strong>
                    locomotives and one for the <strong>CC3300-AC</strong> locomotives. Each brake triangle had distinct
                    specifications, including different diameters and dimensions, which required careful planning and
                    collaboration within the team.
                </p>

                <h4>CC3300 Brake Triangle Development</h4>
                <p>
                    For the <strong>CC3300</strong>, we utilized UPN profiles, which we bent and cut into the required
                    shapes. Our team added end caps to achieve the correct mass while maintaining the necessary
                    diameter. Following this, we reproduced the front shoes. I was responsible for creating detailed 2D
                    drawings and 3D models of the front shoes. Using calipers, measuring tapes, and other traditional
                    reverse engineering methods, I ensured that these components were not only accurately reproducible
                    but also fully manufacturable, in alignment with our project objectives.
                </p>

                <h4>CC3300-AC Brake Triangle Development</h4>
                <p>
                    For the <strong>CC3300-AC</strong>, we machined rectangular iron bars and shaped them into circular
                    forms, closely matching the existing brake triangles. By applying traditional reverse engineering
                    techniques—including manual measurement, geometric analysis, precise dimensioning, and tolerance
                    verification—I produced precise and manufacturable 2D drawings. This approach ensured that each
                    assembly fit accurately and that the components could fully reproduce their intended function.
                </p>

                <h4>Team Collaboration</h4>
                <p>
                    During the project, I worked closely with my team. I helped in the organization of tasks. I also
                    shared ideas and suggestions to help the project move forward (the ideas for the end caps were
                    mine). By working together, we completed all the steps—from machining the raw material, welding the
                    different components, to testing them—to ensure they matched the function and characteristics of the
                    original brake triangles.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I learned an important lesson about the value of collaboration between
                    designers and manufacturers. In my experience, when working in a design office, it is easy to assume
                    that theoretical work—such as 3D modeling and detailed drawings—is sufficient to produce a
                    component. We sometimes think we can complete a design without consulting the manufacturer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this project demonstrated how critical the role of the manufacturer is. They not only help
                    you understand appropriate tolerances based on the materials and machinery available but also enable
                    you to complete the work more efficiently. For example, during the reproduction of the front shoes
                    for the <strong>CC3300-AC</strong> locomotives, I initially applied tolerances that were not
                    suitable for manufacturing because I assumed that their tools and capabilities were the same as
                    those I had encountered in previous workplaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach cost the team a significant amount of time, as we constantly had to review details and
                    ensure that the dimensions were both acceptable and manufacturable. From this experience, I gained a
                    deeper understanding of practical dimensioning techniques and learned how to work humbly and
                    effectively with the manufacturer. By consulting them during the design process, we were able to
                    reduce errors and save time.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    <strong>Key Lesson:</strong> "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."
                    In my case, especially, working alone often led to mistakes, whereas collaborating closely with the
                    team and manufacturers resulted in fewer errors and faster, more accurate outcomes.
