        </section>

        <section class="company-intro">
            <p>During my time at CAMRAIL, I served as a mechanical engineer and 3D modeler, contributing to the
                Compressor test bench optimization and the development of train braking systems.
                The Compressor test bench optimization was a build-to-spec project, while the braking systems followed a
                full development process involving multiple iterations, system integration, and the adaptation of new
                technologies. This work demanded a high level of technical rigor, problem-solving, and close
                collaboration within the team.
                Operating at the edge of practical engineering constraints, the project challenged us to push existing
                limits while ensuring safety, reliability, and performance. Knowing that our work directly supports
                train drivers and serves millions of Cameroonians who rely on these trains every day is a source of deep
                professional pride.
                Below are a few examples of notable engineering challenges and solutions I contributed to during my time
                on the team.</p>

                <h3>Compressor test bench optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    At <strong>CAMRAIL</strong>, I worked on the <strong>optimization and reconfiguration of mechanical
                        and pneumatic systems on intercity locomotives</strong>, focusing on aging models such as the
                    BB1100, CC2200, CC3300, and CC2200, within the context of rolling stock and spare parts shortages.
                    During one critical phase, while preparing locomotives for operational validation, we uncovered
                    subtle incompatibilities in the <strong>locomotive compressor test bench</strong>—a crucial tool for
                    preventive and corrective maintenance. To fully understand the problem and how it was addressed, it
                    is necessary to first understand what the compressor does and how the test bench interfaces with it.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    The locomotive compressor ensures air compression and oil circulation, which are essential for
                    pneumatic systems like braking, control, and auxiliary operations. After significant mileage,
                    compressors require inspection, oil changes, and cleaning. Testing on the bench is therefore
                    critical to verify proper functioning, detect leaks, and ensure reliability before reinstallation in
                    the locomotive. The existing bench, however, was limited to testing only BB1100 and CC2200
                    compressors. Other models, such as CC3300, CC3300 AC, and CC2200, required fragmented and
                    inefficient testing in separate locations, including water tests in the wash area and hydraulic
                    tests in the garage, which introduced time loss, movement inefficiencies, traceability issues, and
                    higher risk of errors.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My role was to <strong>define and implement a new testing methodology</strong> to transform the
                    bench into a versatile, modular, and universal system capable of performing pressurized air, water,
                    and oil tests across multiple compressor types. This involved:
                </p><br>

                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li><strong>3D Modeling and Design:</strong> I completed a full 3D model of the bench, including the
                        main frame, mounting interfaces, and functional testing zones. The design accommodated
                        compressors of widely varying sizes and weights, from compact BB1100 units to larger CC3300
                        compressors.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Low-Cost Modular Frame:</strong> The frame was designed for compatibility with multiple
                        compressors, ease of assembly and disassembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and sufficient
                        mechanical rigidity to limit vibrations during testing.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Functional Analysis and Dynamic Constraints:</strong> I analyzed vibration
                        characteristics, forces from air and fluid jets, and potential interactions between compressors
                        and the bench structure to prevent instability or mechanical failure during testing.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Beyond the test bench, I also addressed <strong>recurrent radiator overheating</strong> in
                    locomotives. This issue arose due to aging fleet components, unavailability of original parts, and
                    the integration of locally designed alternatives that disrupted airflow. My responsibilities
                    included analyzing ventilation impacts, proposing pneumatic system modifications, integrating
                    additional radiator ventilation devices, and ensuring the changes did not interfere with other
                    mechanical or pneumatic systems.

                <h3>Brake supports design</h3>
                <p>
                    During my time at CAMRAIL, I served as a technical contributor on the brake support design and
                    adaptation project for BB1100 and CC3300 locomotives, where original components were no longer
                    available due to supply chain constraints and obsolescence. Working in small technical teams, I
                    confronted a technically challenging task that required us to build the metaphorical fighter jet
                    while flying it. At CAMRAIL, I was tasked with designing and validating brake supports essential for
                    safe braking operations under the demanding conditions of heavy freight transport. During my
                    preliminary analysis, I uncovered an insidious incompatibility between the aging mechanical
                    components and the performance requirements for modern operations. In these pneumatic braking
                    systems, compressed air at 3.8 bars actuates brake cylinders that apply force through a lever
                    mechanism to brake shoes pressing against the wheel's rolling surface. The brake support structure
                    serves as the critical load path between the motorized actuator system and the locomotive's bogie
                    frame. During my investigation, I found that our existing support showed three fundamental failure
                    modes: excessive mechanical play caused by wear of axles and pivots reducing braking precision,
                    fatigue of suspension springs from continuous vibrations leading to loss of rigidity, and corrosion
                    of components from prolonged exposure to weather weakening structural integrity. I documented how
                    these degradation mechanisms manifested as diminished braking effectiveness with longer stopping
                    distances, increased risk of mechanical failure during critical braking events, and potentially
                    catastrophic component breakdowns under load.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Our experienced mechanical engineers in the workshop jumped to conclusions about what they thought
                    was wrong, and rightfully so—they had solid understanding of how the system worked, having
                    maintained these locomotives for years. I called the room to order, grabbed an empty cardboard box
                    out of the workshop (for some reason, this is a theme with me), and started with a single question
                    to the group: what are we actually observing? We were seeing premature wear and excessive deflection
                    in the support structure, and my visual inspection revealed corrosion at weld joints while my
                    dimensional measurements confirmed play in the pivot connections exceeded specification limits by
                    300%. I called attention to the distinction between observing the symptoms and understanding the
                    root causes, and I pushed through the rest of the exercise in what I call "low-gear problem-solving"
                    while gathering insights from the engineers who were far more experienced with these systems than I.
                    Soon I had a sprawling fault tree on the large, flattened cardboard box, and I circled what we
                    agreed were the most probable failure mechanisms and brainstormed how I could "lay a trap" for the
                    problem through systematic analysis.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After splitting the analysis work between team members, I got to work on the solution using
                    SOLIDWORKS for 3D modeling and ANSYS for finite element analysis to design an optimized brake
                    support that addressed all identified failure modes. I added gusset reinforcements at critical load
                    paths to stiffen the structure and reduce deflection, with the support connecting the pneumatic
                    motor assembly to the bogie frame to dissipate braking forces without transmitting undesirable
                    stress concentrations to the bogie structure. I specified S235JR structural steel for the main
                    support structure, selected for its adequate yield strength, good weldability for fabrication,
                    resistance to fatigue under cyclic loading, and cost-effectiveness for rail applications. I refined
                    the support geometry through iterative analysis to maximize stiffness while minimizing weight,
                    distribute loads evenly across connection points, eliminate stress concentrations at weld joints,
                    and provide adequate clearance for maintenance access. My comprehensive structural analysis
                    validated the design showing adequate safety margins and predicted service life exceeding typical
                    locomotive overhaul intervals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The manufacturing process I developed combined precision cutting of steel plate stock,
                    fixture-assisted alignment for consistent weld joint geometry, MIG welding using qualified
                    procedures, post-weld grinding and surface preparation, and protective coating for corrosion
                    resistance. I designed the assembly to follow a systematic protocol with pressure testing, static
                    load testing to 150% of design braking force, and dynamic testing under simulated braking cycles.
                    With the optimized brake support I designed and installed, we achieved significant reduction in
                    maintenance frequency due to reduced wear, improved braking response with tighter mechanical
                    tolerances, extended component life through superior corrosion resistance, and enhanced safety with
                    higher structural safety factors. Throughout this project, I applied methodical engineering analysis
                    using SOLIDWORKS and ANSYS for mechanical design and collaborated closely with multidisciplinary
                    teams including maintenance personnel, fabrication specialists, and operations staff. By taking a
                    systematic, evidence-based approach—verifying observations before jumping to conclusions—I delivered
                    a robust, cost-effective solution that improved locomotive reliability, operational safety, and
                    maintenance efficiency under real-world industrial constraints. <STRONG>The key to my success was
                        not just
                        the technical tools, but the disciplined problem-solving methodology: observe carefully, analyze
                        systematically, validate thoroughly, and always respect the expertise of those who work with the
                        equipment every day.</STRONG>
