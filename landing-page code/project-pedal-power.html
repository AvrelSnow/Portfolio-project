                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>The pedal power mobile phone charger (ppmpc) is a machine which uses human power to generate
                    electricity to charge mobile phones. As the initiator of the project and leader of an
                    interdisciplinary team comprising of 3 bachelor’s students at the Higher Technical Teachers Training
                    College (HTTTC), I played a pivotal role in conceptualizing and implementing the PPMPC project.
                    <br>This project was conceived in response to the acute energy scarcity faced by the local
                    communities of Ange Raphael and the University of Douala as a whole. My primary objective in
                    initiating this project was to provide an alternative to the unreliable national grid supply in the
                    university, thereby ensuring that students have access to a reliable source of power for charging
                    their devices and facilitating their research endeavours.This project was done in 3 weeks,from
                    febuary to march.
                <ul>
                    <li>We Implemented DFM principles to reduce product assembly costs.
                    <li>Used the <strong>Empathize-Define-Ideate-Prototype-Test</strong> strategies when working on this
                        design
                    <li>the Assembly was designed using Solidorks,Rendering and animation were done with keyshot,Premier
                        pro and adobe after effects was used to create the video..

                <h3>Design & Build</h3>
                <p>The design and manufacturing process involved numerous sketches, rough proofs-of-concept, calibration
                    and precision in the mounting of the different electronic components. Furthermore, I took a lot of
                    time on the design of the frame of the machine because I emphasized mostly the user's comfort. CAD
                    designs of the PPMPC as well as the electronic setup were constantly revised to meet the needs of
                    the team and user specifications.
                    <br>I conducted the entire research, ideation, and prototyping process, including learning weldment
                    designs and SolidWorks advanced part design over the course of 1 weeks. After completing my course,
                    the team hired me to finish the first working prototype of the frame and the mountings of the
                    different electronic parts for a presentation at the HTTTC Science and Engineering Festival, and the
                    mechanical engineering department’s new bees welcoming.

                <p>Testing and validation was to ensure that the charger meets performance and safety standards.
                    <br>In this analysis, we examine the effort exerted by both the bike frame and the rider’s body, and
                    how these forces impact the support structure and special bolt. To achieve this, a static structural
                    analysis was conducted using SOLIDWORKS.

                            the model to ensure realistic behavior under loading. The Von Mises stress chart confirms
                            that the support structure is capable of withstanding a load exceeding 800 N without
                            failure.

                <ul>
                    <li>Ergonomic Adjustment:
                        The design was optimized by determining an appropriate height that ensures user comfort while
                        accommodating a wide range of riders, from the <strong>5th percentile female</strong> to the
                        <strong>95th percentile male</strong>.

                    <li>Structural Reinforcement:
                        Gussets were strategically added to critical joints to minimize the risk of fatigue failure and
                        enhance overall durability of the support system.

                    <li>Weight Optimization:
                        The design was refined to maintain a <strong>weight of 40 kg</strong>, ensuring portability
