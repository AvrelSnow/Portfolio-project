                    <p>
                        For our work on the brake triangle, I was part of a team of four engineers tasked with
                        reproducing new brake triangles compatible with the <strong>CC2200</strong> and
                        <strong>CC3300AC</strong> locomotives. We were required to manufacture two different brake
                        triangles to address the problem of stock shortages, as these locomotives were very old and
                        their spare parts were no longer available on the market. It was therefore necessary to produce
                        their components locally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The objective was to design a system that closely matched and remained fully compatible with
                        these locomotives while ensuring acceptable durability and functional performance comparable to
                        the original imported parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of the project requirements, we transitioned from the older Shielded Metal Arc Welding
                        (SMAW) method—commonly known as arc welding with coated electrodes—to more advanced welding
                        techniques: <strong>MIG-MAG</strong> (Metal Inert Gas – Metal Active Gas). This shift aimed to
                        improve weld quality, structural integrity, and compliance with the structural standards and
                        regulations of the Cameroonian railway system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To facilitate this change, we were equipped with the <strong>Lincoln Electric Power MIG
                            360MP</strong> and <strong>2 Fronius TransSteel 2700</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My specific objective in this project was to produce detailed 2D diagrams and 3D models,
                        ensuring that all dimensions and tolerances remained within acceptable limits. This was
                        essential to guarantee that the brake triangles could be easily integrated into the locomotives
                        and perform the same function as the reference components. The task was conducted as a reverse
                        engineering project, taking into account existing designs, spatial constraints, functional
                        requirements, and local material availability.

                        In this project, our team of four (consisting of Gille team lead, Mbella Jacques chief
                        technician and his assistant Ricardo) produced two brake triangles: one for the
                        <strong>CC2200</strong> locomotives and one for the <strong>CC3300-AC</strong> locomotives. Each
                        brake triangle had distinct specifications, including different diameters and dimensions, which
                        required careful planning and collaboration within the team.

                        For the <strong>CC3300</strong>, we utilized UPN profiles, which we bent and cut into the
                        required shapes. Our team added end caps to achieve the correct mass while maintaining the
                        necessary diameter. Following this, we reproduced the front shoes. I was responsible for
                        creating detailed 2D drawings and 3D models of the front shoes. Using calipers, measuring tapes,
                        and other traditional reverse engineering methods, I ensured that these components were not only
                        accurately reproducible but also fully manufacturable, in alignment with our project objectives.

                        For the <strong>CC3300-AC</strong>, we machined rectangular iron bars and shaped them into
                        circular forms, closely matching the existing brake triangles. By applying traditional reverse
                        engineering techniques—including manual measurement, geometric analysis, precise dimensioning,
                        and tolerance verification—I produced precise and manufacturable 2D drawings. This approach
                        ensured that each assembly fit accurately and that the components could fully reproduce their
                        intended function.

                        During the project, I worked closely with my team. I helped in the organization of tasks. I also
                        shared ideas and suggestions to help the project move forward (the ideas for the end caps were
                        mine). By working together, we completed all the steps—from machining the raw material, welding
                        the different components, to testing them—to ensure they matched the function and
                        characteristics of the original brake triangles.

                    <p>
                        Through this project, I learned an important lesson about the value of collaboration between
                        designers and manufacturers. In my experience, when working in a design office, it is easy to
                        assume that theoretical work—such as 3D modeling and detailed drawings—is sufficient to produce
                        a component. We sometimes think we can complete a design without consulting the manufacturer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this project demonstrated how critical the role of the manufacturer is. They not only
                        help you understand appropriate tolerances based on the materials and machinery available but
                        also enable you to complete the work more efficiently. For example, during the reproduction of
                        the front shoes for the <strong>CC3300-AC</strong> locomotives, I initially applied tolerances
                        that were not suitable for manufacturing because I assumed that their tools and capabilities
                        were the same as those I had encountered in previous workplaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach cost the team a significant amount of time, as we constantly had to review details
                        and ensure that the dimensions were both acceptable and manufacturable. From this experience, I
                        gained a deeper understanding of practical dimensioning techniques and learned how to work
                        humbly and effectively with the manufacturer. By consulting them during the design process, we
                        were able to reduce errors and save time.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="subsection-heading">Key Lesson</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."</strong> In my
                        case, especially, working alone often led to mistakes, whereas collaborating closely with the
                        team and manufacturers resulted in fewer errors and faster, more accurate outcomes.
